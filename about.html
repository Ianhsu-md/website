        <h1>MY STORY</h1>
        <p>I grew up living in the American Midwest, Europe, and Asia, speaking Mandarin Chinese at home and English at school.
          Though in my earlier years I hadnâ€™t necessarily dreamt of a career in psychiatry, looking back, I had always paid close attention to the emotional experiences of myself and those around me.
        <br><br>
        Part of what drew me to pursue medical school was the opportunity to listen to and help those who are struggling with illness, and my later choice to specialize in psychiatry felt like a natural destination.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I live in New York City, where I am an attending physician and faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
        My role there involves providing psychiatric consultations to the general medical hospital and teaching medical students and residents.</p>
